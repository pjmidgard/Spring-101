Algorithm Spring-101

2-9 1 long 1  try predict 2 long and 0 add on the start before last 0-2 bits for last 0-2 bits (2**16)-1 times and Reverso. For predict information we start to count from 10-99 every step and every times of compress save number that start if 1 number is find.

Predict long 2 numbers.

We need two tables.


Also, I have made the table to change 2-3 numbers of predict numbers 10-99 : 222-353 first step we change 3 bits to 2-9. Change to table 2-3 numbers from 10-99 : 222-353  try Predict change to ones and +1 100-10 predict save like 0 zero and zero to one on the end. Add 0 and count how many last bits with one on start with number e.g.: 1-3: save this on the end. Save 3 numbers we repeat this again and again. Reverso table. First we predict number with zero and one after compress number with not zero and with zero and try predict the same numbers need to find.
