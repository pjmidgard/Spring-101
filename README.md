Algorithm Init

E.G.:101 -2; 202-3...

2-9 1 long  1  predict 2 long and 0 add on the start before last 0-2 bits for last 0-2 bits (2**16)-1 times and Reverso.
For predict information we start to count from 10-99 every step and every times of compress save number that start if 1 number is find.

Predict long 2 numbers.

Also, I have made the table to change 2-3 numbers of predict numbers 10-99 : 222-353
first step we change 3 bits to 2-9.
change to table 2-3 numbers from 10-99 : 222-353
Predict change to ones after change 1-0 and 0-1 and on the end.
add 0 and count how many last bits wich one on start  wich number e.g.: 1-3:
