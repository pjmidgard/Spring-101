Algorithm Xinitx2

2-9 1 long 1 predict 2 long and 0 add on the start before last 0-2 bits for last 0-2 bits (2**16)-1 times and Reverso. For predict information we start to count from 10-99 every step and every times of compress save number that start if 1 number is find.

Predict long 2 numbers.

We need two tables.


Also, I have made the table to change 2-3 numbers of predict numbers 10-99 : 222-353 first step we change 3 bits to 2-9. Change to table 2-3 numbers from 10-99 : 222-353 We need reverso table. Predict change to ones and +1 100-10 predict save like 0 zero and zero to one on the end. Add 0 and count how many last bits with one on start with number e.g.: 1-3: save this on the end. We need to Reverso ones and zeros and save 3 numbers when we have at list one ones we repeat this again and again. Combination should increase. 3-2n 4-3n one zeroes. Should not repeat together ones and zeroes because we should skip numbers with 1 and 0. It should increase when we at list find that predict 1 time. Count times when find at least one time.
Divide file blocks.
