Algorithm Spring-101

2-9 1 long 1  try predict 2 long and 0 add on the start before last 0-2 bits for last 0-2 bits one time and Reverso. For predict information we start to count from 10-99 every step and every times of compress save number that start if 1 number is find.

Predict long 2 or more numbers.

Alpredict numbers 10-99 first step we change 3 bits to 2-9. Numbers should be from 10-99 try Predict change to ones and +1 100-10 predict save like 0.
